Ah, .NET. As a young classic ASP web developer frustrated with no real oppurtunity to do "proper programming" in classic ASP in frontpage, .NET was very exciting for me. I've been coding in it professionaly since the early days. From the "awe-inspring" world of WebForms with hilarious viewstate hiding the connection from the front-end to the back-end, through the mind-boggling world of AJAX with the Microsoft AJAX Library (just plop a Panel and you're good to go), all the way to now... 

And it's got to be said, where we are now is a lovely place in .NET. You've got true mutli-platform support, Minimal APIs, Razor Pages, and Blazor. It's all very nice isn't it.

And yet, the enthusiasm is waning. New version after new version, hey look at these cool new language features, we should all be using Records now, hey look you can now do X in about 100 ways. C# is dynamic, it's functional, it's everything to everyone! Microsft are pushing new stuff at a rate of knots that is just fast becoming, at least for me, a bit tiresome. I think these tweets sum it up nicely.

You can see where I'm going here.

So yeah, Go. It's a very different world. The language has been around for a long time now and apart from gaining generics, it's barely changed. The language is simple, but the simplicity constrains you in a very refreshing way - it stops you from trying to be too clever with your code. This couldn't be further away from .NET. Simplicity is Complicated.

I've been lurking out in www.reddit.com/r/golang, where there is a sense of "only use 3rd party libraries if you absolutely need to". You can do everything you can do in .NET, but you might have to write it all yourself. This feels liberating, at least right now it does. 

Maybe after a few weeks playing with this I'll change my mind. But right now, I'm excited to find out more..
